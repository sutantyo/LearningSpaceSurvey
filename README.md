# LearningSpaceSurvey

The department wants your feedback for the new computer labs and learning space we are going to open in the BD building. 
Unfortunately we have to do this very quickly because they need the feedback by Monday night (18th May 2020) since
the admin team have to compile the list and send it to the higher ups on Tuesday.

To use this github, please head on to 'Issues' and check out the existing suggestions. Feel free to add your voice in the comments.
If you have a suggestion that hasn't been posted, please make one and, if you can, give it a label 'need' or 'wish', 
respectively for things
which you think are vital and for things which would be nice to have, but not super important.
There is also 'discussion' and 'question' labels if you just want to start something up. I can add more labels later.
If the department already agreed on something in the past, I'll add on the 'approved' label, so please don't use this one. 

I am going to add some files which we can share later.
