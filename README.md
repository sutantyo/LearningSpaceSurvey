# Lab and Learning Space Survey

The department wants your feedback for the new computer labs and learning space we are going to open in the BD building. 
Unfortunately we have to do this very quickly because they need the feedback by Monday night (18th May 2020) since
the admin team have to compile the list and send it to the higher ups on Tuesday.

To use this github, please head on to 'Issues' and check out the existing suggestions. Feel free to add your voice in the comments.
If you have a suggestion that hasn't been posted, you can certainly make one. For each topic, either say 'Lab' or 'Space' at the start,
so that we can organise this easier later.

Please also tell us what label we should apply to it (only contributors canadd labels)
- **need** for things you think are important
- **wish** for things which would be nice to have, but you can live without
- **question** or **discussion** if you just want to post a question or discuss things that are already approved
- **approved** or **notgonnahappen** are for when we either agree or disagree on something (the department will have the final
say), so please don't use these
